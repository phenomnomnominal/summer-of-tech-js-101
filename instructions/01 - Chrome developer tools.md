# Chrome developer tools!

## What are they?

Developer tools are tools for developers üòé. They help us to build and debug our code! Most modern web browsers (such as Firefox, Safari, or Edge) come with their own set of tools. Throughout this workshop we're going to use the "**dev tools**" that are built into **Google Chrome**. If you don't have Chrome installed, do that now! You can find it [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

The Chrome Dev Tools look something like this:

You can access the dev tools from any website by right clicking and clicking "**Inspect**". You could also use the keyboard shortcut, which is (Cmd + Opt + I) on Mac, and F12 on Windows.

There tools are invaluable to web developers, and you will likely spend a lot of time using them! They can help debug all kinds of problems with your code, whether it's performance issues, network issues, rendering issues or your code just not working.

We're going to spend most of our time using the "**Console**" and "**Sources**" panels, but take a few minutes to look through the other features.

## Try it out!

Start off by going to your favourite website, then just have a little poke around inside the developer tools.

**Here are some things you could try**:

* Open the "**Elements**" panel and try clicking on an element within the HTML. Try playing with some of the styles and see how the page changes.
* Open the "**Network**" panel and refresh the page. Watch all the requests come in as the page loads, and then click on a few individual requests and investigate what is going on there.
* Open the "**Lighthouse**" panel and then click "**Analyze page load...**". Have a look through the information in the audit report.

## Next

Once you're done, you can move onto the next step to learn about [**Github**](./02%20-%20Github.md). üëèüëèüëè

## More info:

You can learn a bunch more about Dev Tools from the [Google documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools). Most other browsers have their own developer tools, so you don't always have to use Chrome!
